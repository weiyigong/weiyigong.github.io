I'm a PhD candidate in [Physics](https://cos.northeastern.edu/physics/) at Northeastern University, 
supervised by [Prof. Qimin Yan](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/qimin-yan/). I worked at the [Innovation Campus](https://www.burlington.northeastern.edu/) at Burlington, MA.

I obtained my BSc in Physics in 2017, MPhil in Physics in 2019 from Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
I was a PhD candidate in Physics at Temple University from 2019 to 2022, after that I was transferred to Northeastern University.

My current research focuses on the acceleration of material discovery by combining innovations from condensed matter physics (theoretical and computational) and machine learning. 
Specifically, I'm interested in incorporating physics principles into deep learning models for both molecules and solid-state material systems.
