abstract = {Magneto-ionics, real-time ionic control of magnetism in solid-state materials, promise ultralow-power memory, computing, and ultralow-field sensor technologies. The real-time ion intercalation is also the key state-of-charge feature in rechargeable batteries. Here, we report that the reversible lithiation/delithiation in molecular magneto-ionic material, the cathode in a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, accurately monitors its real-time state of charge through a dynamic tunability of magnetic ordering. The electrochemical and magnetic studies confirm that the structural vacancy and hydrogen-bonding networks enable reversible lithiation and delithiation in the magnetic cathode. Coupling with microwave-excited spin wave at a low frequency (0.35 GHz) and a magnetic field of 100 Oe, we reveal a fast and reliable built-in magneto-ionic sensor monitoring state of charge in rechargeable batteries. The findings shown herein promise an integration of molecular magneto-ionic cathode and rechargeable batteries for real-time monitoring of state of charge.}}

abstract = {A structure motif–centric, graph-based deep learning framework for inorganic crystalline materials is proposed. Incorporation of physical principles in a machine learning (ML) architecture is a fundamental step toward the continued development of artificial intelligence for inorganic materials. As inspired by the Pauling’s rule, we propose that structure motifs in inorganic crystals can serve as a central input to a machine learning framework. We demonstrated that the presence of structure motifs and their connections in a large set of crystalline compounds can be converted into unique vector representations using an unsupervised learning algorithm. To demonstrate the use of structure motif information, a motif-centric learning framework is created by combining motif information with the atom-based graph neural networks to form an atom-motif dual graph network (AMDNet), which is more accurate in predicting the electronic structures of metal oxides such as bandgaps. The work illustrates the route toward fundamental design of graph neural network learning architecture for complex materials by incorporating beyond-atom physical principles.}}
